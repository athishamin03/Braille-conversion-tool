# Braille conversion tool
 Automated Braille Conversion Tool  Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in accessing printed or digital  information due to limited availability of Braille formats for books, documents, and web  content. Participants are invited to create an AI-driven tool that converts any text—printed or  digital—into Braille, providing a seamless way for users to access information. This solution  could integrate with printers, digital devices, and web content to enhance accessibility,  enabling visually impaired users to gain greater independence and information access.
